This is meant to be a voting tool but its like those minecraft speedrun seed selectors and all

the naming conventions and bassed on the minecraft things not the voting things to make it easyer for me

- Getting the raw html from the server - `generate_seed`
- Parsing the html to show the project in the tool - `load_seed`
- Displaying the project to the user - `display_seed`
- User selecting the project to look into it more - `play_seed`
- User discarding the project - `trash_seed`
- User votes on a project - `end_seed`
